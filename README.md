SOLID Principles, study to exemplify LSP, based on the following given scenario:

"Suppose we have 3 databases (Mortgage Customers, Current Accounts Customers
and Savings Account Customers) that provide customer data and we need customer details for
given customer's last name. Now we may get more than 1 customer detail from those 3 databases
against given last name."
